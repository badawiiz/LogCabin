People live in the online world more than ever and constantly need to make accounts for saving information.
Every site or application we visit that wishes to save this sensitive information must keep it safe from others through authentication.
While usernames and passwords keep us safe from others, if we forget our own it becomes a hindrance to ourselves.
People will forget their own information at some point and LogCabin is here to prevent that. LogCabin is a web application for keeping track of important usernames and passwords.
Run the application, visit the site, and click on the icon of the account to see your saved username, password, and additional notes.

Created in Eclipse mainly consisting of the LogcabinApplication.java, LogcabinController.java, and two webpages.
Table logging and database management controlled through phpMyAdmin and utilizing WampServer.
